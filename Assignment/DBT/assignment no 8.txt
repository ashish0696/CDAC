1) Assume each salesperson has a 12% commission. Write a query on the orders table that will produce the order number, the salesperson number, and the amount of the salespersonâ€™s commission for that order.

mysql> select onum,snum,amt,
    -> amt*0.12 Commission
    -> from orders;
+------+------+---------+------------+
| onum | snum | amt     | Commission |
+------+------+---------+------------+
| 3001 | 1007 |   18.69 |       2.24 |
| 3003 | 1001 |  767.19 |      92.06 |
| 3002 | 1004 | 1900.10 |     228.01 |
| 3005 | 1002 | 5160.45 |     619.25 |
| 3006 | 1007 | 1098.16 |     131.78 |
| 3009 | 1003 | 1713.23 |     205.59 |
| 3007 | 1002 |   75.75 |       9.09 |
| 3008 | 1001 | 4723.00 |     566.76 |
| 3010 | 1002 | 1309.95 |     157.19 |
| 3011 | 1001 | 9891.88 |    1187.03 |
+------+------+---------+------------+

2) Write a query on the Customers table that will find the highest rating in each city. Put the output in this form:
For the city (city), the highest rating is : (rating).

mysql> select city as 'for the city (city)', max(rating) as 'the highestrating is : (rating)' from customers
    -> group by city;
+---------------------+---------------------------------+
| for the city (city) | the highestrating is : (rating) |
+---------------------+---------------------------------+
| London              |                             100 |
| Rome                |                             200 |
| San Jose            |                             300 |
| Berlin              |                             300 |
+---------------------+---------------------------------+

3) Write a query that lists customers in descending order of rating. Output the rating field first, followed by the customerâ€™s name and number.

mysql> select rating,cname,cnum from customers
    -> order by 1 desc;
+--------+----------+------+
| rating | cname    | cnum |
+--------+----------+------+
|    300 | Grass    | 2004 |
|    300 | Cisneros | 2008 |
|    200 | Giovanni | 2002 |
|    200 | Liu      | 2003 |
|    100 | Hoffman  | 2001 |
|    100 | Clemens  | 2006 |
|    100 | Pereira  | 2007 |
+--------+----------+------+

4) Write a query that totals the orders for each day and places the results in descending order.

mysql> select distinct odate, count(onum) from orders
    -> group by odate
    -> order by 2 desc;
+------------+-------------+
| odate      | count(onum) |
+------------+-------------+
| 1990-10-03 |           5 |
| 1990-10-04 |           2 |
| 1990-10-06 |           2 |
| 1990-10-05 |           1 |
+------------+-------------+
